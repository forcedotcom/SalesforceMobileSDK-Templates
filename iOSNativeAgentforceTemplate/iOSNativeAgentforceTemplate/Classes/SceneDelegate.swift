/**
 * SceneDelegate manages the window and view hierarchy for the iOS scene.
 * 
 * This delegate class handles the lifecycle of individual UI scenes in the app,
 * including window setup, authentication state changes, and root view controller
 * management. It bridges between UIKit scene management and SwiftUI content.
 * 
 * ## Key Responsibilities
 * - Initialize and configure the app window
 * - Handle authentication state changes
 * - Manage root view controller transitions
 * - Set up Salesforce data stores and synchronization
 * - Process URL opening requests within scenes
 * 
 * ## Architecture Integration
 * The SceneDelegate coordinates between:
 * - Salesforce Mobile SDK authentication
 * - SwiftUI-based main interface (AgentforceLander)
 * - UIKit-based initial loading screen
 * - MobileSync data management
 * 
 * ## Authentication Flow
 * 1. Scene connects and registers for auth change notifications
 * 2. App enters foreground and checks authentication status
 * 3. If authenticated, sets up main SwiftUI interface
 * 4. If not authenticated, triggers login flow
 * 5. On auth change, resets view state and updates interface

    * 
    * ## MobileSync Configuration
    * The method sets up two key MobileSync components:
    * 1. **User Store**: Configures local data storage from userstore.json
    * 2. **User Syncs**: Sets up data synchronization from usersyncs.json

    * - Offline data access
    * - Automatic sync with Salesforce
    * - Conflict resolution
    * - Local caching strategies

    * - AgentforceLander: Main tabbed interface
    * - AgentforceLandingViewModel: View state management
    * - Settings: Global app configuration
    * 
    * ## Data Layer Setup

    * - SmartStore database setup
    * - SyncManager initialization
    * - Data models and sobject definitions
    * - Sync schedules and policies

    * - User logs out while modal is presented
    * - Authentication expires during active session
    * - Account switching with active presentations
    * - App backgrounding/foregrounding with modals

    * ## Safety Mechanism
    * The method ensures clean UI state transitions by:
    * 1. Checking for any presented view controllers
    * 2. Dismissing them without animation for immediate cleanup
    * 3. Executing the completion block after dismissal
    * 4. Calling the completion block immediately if no presentations exist

    * - Parameter postResetBlock: Block to execute after view state is reset
