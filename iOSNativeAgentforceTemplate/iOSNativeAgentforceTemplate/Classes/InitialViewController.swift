/**
 * InitialViewController provides the initial loading screen for the Agentforce app.
 * 
 * This minimal view controller serves as a placeholder while the app initializes
 * the Salesforce Mobile SDK, checks authentication status, and prepares the main
 * interface. It's displayed immediately when the app launches to provide immediate
 * visual feedback to users.
 * 
 * ## Purpose and Usage
 * The InitialViewController is used in several scenarios:
 * - App startup while SDK initializes
 * - Authentication status verification
 * - Transition periods between login states
 * - Background-to-foreground app transitions
 * 
 * ## Lifecycle Integration
 * This view controller is managed by SceneDelegate:
 * 1. Set as root view controller during `initializeAppViewState()`
 * 2. Displayed while `AuthHelper.loginIfRequired()` executes
 * 3. Replaced by main SwiftUI interface after authentication
 * 4. May be shown again during auth state changes
 * 
 * ## Design Considerations
 * The view controller is intentionally minimal to:
 * - Load quickly and reduce perceived startup time
 * - Avoid complex UI that could delay app initialization
 * - Provide consistent experience across different entry points
 * - Serve as a neutral background during transitions
 * 
 * ## Customization Options
 * To customize the initial screen appearance:
 * - Override `viewDidLoad()` to configure the background color
 * - Add a logo or branding elements in `viewWillAppear()`
 * - Implement loading indicators for longer initialization times
 * - Add fade-in/fade-out animations for smoother transitions
 * 
 * ## Example Customization
 * ```swift
 * override func viewDidLoad() {
 *     super.viewDidLoad()
 *     view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemBackground
 *     
 *     // Add logo or branding
 *     let logoImageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "app-logo"))
 *     logoImageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
 *     // Configure constraints and add to view hierarchy
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Notes
 * Keep this view controller lightweight since it's created frequently during
 * app lifecycle transitions. Avoid expensive operations in viewDidLoad or
 * viewWillAppear that could delay the user experience.

     * Configures the view controller after loading.
     * 
     * This method is called after the view controller's view is loaded into memory.
     * The default implementation provides a minimal setup suitable for a loading screen.
     * 
     * ## Default Behavior
     * The base implementation handles basic view controller setup. Override this
     * method to add custom branding, styling, or loading indicators.
     * 
     * ## Customization Examples
     * - Set background color to match app theme
     * - Add company logo or app branding
     * - Include loading spinner or progress indicator
     * - Set up accessibility identifiers for testing
     * 
     * ## Performance Considerations
     * Keep implementations lightweight since this view loads frequently during
     * authentication transitions and app lifecycle events.
